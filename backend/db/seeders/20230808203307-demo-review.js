The night brings amazing stars and the day is just so beautiful and peaceful. Definitely a special place and the home has everything you need! The HomePod was so fun to use - first time!! Between the home itself and the environment, this place was amazing to do a solo trip. The drive into it and out is something I still miss!!!",
