YumBnB, an AirBnB clone, is a website that connects people who want to rent out their properties to those that are looking for innovative and affordable spots to stay around the world. It was built during my time as a student developer at App Academy. The aim of this project was to integrate two weeks' worth of learning React and Redux to build a compelling front-end off of my completed Express back-end project in order to complete my first ever full-stack application.
